#### <sub><sup><a name="5831" href="#5831">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature
* Operators can now hide public pipelines by passing `--disable-public-pipelines=true`. This has many optimizations to help reduce clutter and speed up atc's serving dashboard requests. Public pipelines are still reachable via direct links.  

#### <sub><sup><a name="5780" href="#5780">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Fixed a regression where builds could be stuck pending forever if an input was pinned by partially specifying a version via the [`version:` on a `get` step](https://concourse-ci.org/jobs.html#schema.step.get-step.version), [`version:` on a resource config](https://concourse-ci.org/resources.html#schema.resource.version) or by running [`fly pin-resource`](https://concourse-ci.org/managing-resources.html#fly-pin-resource). #5780

#### <sub><sup><a name="5758" href="#5758">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* @evanchaoli fixed a regression that prevented using both [static vars] and [dynamic vars] simultaneously in a task. #5758

[static vars]: https://concourse-ci.org/vars.html#static-vars
[dynamic vars]: https://concourse-ci.org/vars.html#dynamic-vars

#### <sub><sup><a name="5782" href="#5782">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* The sidebar can now be expanded in the UI - no more long pipeline names being cut off! #5782

#### <sub><sup><a name="5390" href="#5390">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* Add `--include-archived` flag for `fly pipelines` command. #5673

#### <sub><sup><a name="5770" href="#5770">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* `fly login` now accepts arbitrarily long tokens when pasting the token manually into the console. Previously, the limit was OS dependent (with OSX having a relatively small maximum length of 1024 characters). This has been a long-standing issue, but it became most noticable after 6.1.0 which significantly increased the size of tokens. Note that pasted token is now hidden in the console output. #5770
