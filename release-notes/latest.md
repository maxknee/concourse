#### <sub><sup><a name="5831" href="#5831">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature
* Operators can now hide public pipelines by passing `--disable-public-pipelines=true`. This has many optimizations to help reduce clutter and speed up atc's serving dashboard requests. Public pipelines are still reachable via direct links.  

#### <sub><sup><a name="5830" href="#5830">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Fix a validation issue where a step can be set with 0 attempts causing the ATC to panic. #5830

#### <sub><sup><a name="5842" href="#5842">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* Added recover for panic error that used to crash the cluster. Now it should be less easy to panic (we hope!) and if it does, panic error could be found on Stderr and log. #5842

#### <sub><sup><a name="5810" href="#5810">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* Reduce the allowed character set for Concourse valid identifiers. Only prints warnings instead of errors as a first step. #5810
